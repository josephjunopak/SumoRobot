Conditions: </br>
The regulations provided the few constraints on our robot design which included maximums on size and weight. The robot wasnâ€™t allowed to be heavier than three pounds or bigger than sixteen inches by twelve inches. Those were the main regulations for our robots, which we had to comply with in order to be allowed to compete.
